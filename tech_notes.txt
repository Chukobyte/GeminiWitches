*A quick description about object responsibility*
*************************************************

*************************************
*Ingredients are the basis of spells*
*************************************

-There are permanent spells a witch can learn by combining magic power, ingredient/s, and soul gems.

-The magic power limitation is somewhat of a level cap on the spells you can learn.  Since an mp boosting is required for more 
powerful spells.

-Permanent spells form a neutral and character specific skill tree.

-The level up mechanism needs to be fleshed out.

***********
*SOUL GEMS*
***********

-Gems can be obtained naturally by leveling up, or by finding them in special spots (sometimes hidden).

-Gems also affect passives as well.  For instance fire gems can lead to more fire based passives unlocking!

- Each gem corresponds to a certain element.  There will also be neutral gems which can feed any element.  More on elements in the
the next section.

**********
*Elements*
**********
Five for now.  Passives help boost spell abilities.

*Fire
- Most abilities will focus on laying down flames, some projectiles.  Which last on the field after awhile and can damage enemies.  Passives can
also help reduce the damage of fire in the environment to the player.

*Water
- Abilities include affecting clouds, water pools, shooting water bullets.  Boost water power when near water.  Also can help with swimming maybe?

*Wind
- Deals with flying and blowing enemies away.  If they hit terrain they sustain damage.

*Earth
-Can deal damage to multiple enemies at once with the right conditions.  Cause rock slides.  Have special powers near trees?

*Soul
-Character specific powers.  The other elements are shared between all characters, but the soul element is character specific.
