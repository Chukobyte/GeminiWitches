*SOUL GEMS*
***********

-Gems can be obtained naturally by leveling up, or by finding them in special spots (sometimes hidden).

-Gems also affect passives as well.  For instance fire gems can lead to more fire based passives unlocking!

- Each gem corresponds to a certain element.  There will also be neutral gems which can feed any element.  More on elements in the
the next section.

**********
*Elements*
**********
Five for now.  Passives help boost spell abilities.  (Will eventually choose a specialty in the beginning)

**Fire
- Most abilities will focus on laying down flames, some projectiles.  Which last on the field after awhile and can damage enemies.  Passives can
also help reduce the damage of fire in the environment to the player.

Release 1:
*Flame Burst
- Flames burst from the player forming a flame shield.

*Increase Attack Strength

Release 2:
*Flame burst fire shield doubles

**Water
- Abilities include affecting clouds, water pools, shooting water bullets.  Boost water power when near water.  Also can help with swimming maybe?

Release 1:
*Piecing Water Crystal
- Able to go through walls 
- Become larger under water

*Swim Faster

Release 2:
*Summon Water, Rain?

**Wind
- Deals with flying and blowing enemies away.  If they hit terrain they sustain damage.
