** About ** 

This is my first game with Game Maker studio and in general. It's currently incomplete now, but I'm adding more content on a consistent basis. Any feedback is appreciated. 

** Story ** 

The evil saturnian devil magicians have stolen earth's precious elemental gems! Help Seika and Amaya restore peace to the earth by defeating the evil magicians before they harness the power of the gems! 

Collect the gems to unlock new powers and abilities! Seika and Amaya both start with attack and mirror shot.
